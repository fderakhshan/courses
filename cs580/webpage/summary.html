		<h3>Objectives and Methodology</h3>

		<p>This course offers a survey and training of software engineering (SE) research and practice. This is a graduate course, and is designed to complement some of the things that you may have learned in an undergraduate SE course. The course will aim to strike a balance between topics that are of a research focus, and topics that are more practical to software development in the industry today. In this course, you will read some of the most classic papers of SE and also learn the trending SE approaches, tools, skills and practices that will aid you in the ability to construct better software.</p>

		<h3>General Description</h3>

		<p>The course consists of four hours of lecture per week. Lecture will include a summary of the material provided in the <a href="slides.html">Class Slides</a>, as well as other examples. The code and examples performed by the instructor will be made available after class&mdash;see <a href="examples.html">Code examples</a>.</p>

		<p><i>Students are required to bring laptop computers to class in order to work in-class examples</i>.</p>

		<h3>Schedule</h3>

		<p><a href="schedule.html">More information about the course's schedule</a>.</p>

		<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

		<p>You should be comfortable writing code in Java. In addition, if you have not had the equivalent prerequisite of CS 356 and CS 480, you are advised to take them first.</p>

		<h3>Text</h3>

		<p>I will hand out some papers in class for you as reading assignments. No textbook is required, although I will list some recommended books that are helpful for the key topics related with this course. Most of the course content will be documented in slides.</p>

		<p><a href="readings.html">More information about the course's readings</a>.</p>

		<h3>Assignments & Grading</h3>

		<p>There will be NO midterm or final exams for this course.</p> 
		<p>Your final grade will be determined by the total score of the 10 homework assignments you are given during this course.</p> 

		<p>The 10 assignments are designed in the context of a web application project, and cover the key topics of this course. By doing the assignments, you will experience and practice the important SE theories, principles, tools, and methods learned in the class, which is very similar to the majority of the work you are expected to accomplish as a software engineer in the software industry today.</p>

		<p>The score of each assignment ranges from 5 to 20 depending on its complexity and efforts required, and the total score of all 10 assignments will be 100. Homework assignment due date will be given. Late submission will be subject to a penalty.</p>

		<h3>Honor Code</h3>

		<p>View a detailed description of your obligations with regard to the <a href="honor.html">honor code</a> in this course. Read this description carefully before working on the first assignment in this course. It is your obligation to make certain that you understand and abide by these rules. If you have any doubts, ask your instructor for clarification, not another student, and not a teaching assistant.</p>
		<p>Each student is to do his or her own work. This means that you are not to seek out the help of other students (or give help, if asked) in order to solve specific problems of your homework assignments. It also means that you should not sign up for mailing lists and ask for detailed help from others on the Internet. Of course, you may discuss generalities about an assignment with your fellow students. If you are unsure of what is permitted, in terms of discussing an assignment problem, please ask me for clarification.</p>

		<h3>Disabilities</h3>
		<p>If you have any disability that would put you at a disadvantage in performing an assignment, please meet with me privately to discuss ways in which I can assist you as you perform the required work in this course.</p>

		<h3>Tardiness</h3>
		<p>You are expected to arrive on time so that you do not cause a disruption in the middle of class. I would like to start the class at the scheduled time. If you cannot make it on time for some reason, please let me know. Persistent tardiness will be noted.</p>
