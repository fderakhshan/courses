		<h1>Honor Code Obligations</h1>

		<p>The Honor Code of Vanderbilt University applies to all graded work in CS 103. Unless your instructor specifically states otherwise in writing, this work comprises any quizzes, homework, laboratory exercises, programming assignments, tests, examinations, or final examination that are graded for this course. You may neither receive unauthorized help with this work nor give help to someone who is not given explicit permission by the instructor to receive it.</p>

		<p>Your instructor and teaching assistant(s) are authorized to give you help on all work. (Help will not be given if it provides an unfair advantage.)</p>

		<p>You must sign the following honor pledge on every test/examination:</p>

		<p align="center"><b>I pledge my honor that I have neither given nor received aid on this work.</b></p>

		<p>Please note: This requirement is included at the request of Vanderbilt's Honor Council. If you have questions about the Honor Code or the Honor Council, you may ask your professor or visit the <a href="http://studentorgs.vanderbilt.edu/HonorCouncil/">Honor Council website</a>.</p>

		<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<p>The following are specific rules regarding exams and programming projects:</p>

		<h3>Exams</h3>

		<p>Exam instructions will be explained in class.  In short, you are allowed to have only erasers, pencils, and your exam paper on your desk.  No other items or materials are allowed.  You are not allowed to use your laptop or calculators in this class (you will not need either for exams!).  You are not allowed to have scrap paper on your desk.  You must use the margins and/or back of your test paper for calculations.  If you are caught with any other items or materials on your desk, you will be reported to the Honor Council.</p>
		<p>If you miss an exam, due to sickness or any other reason, you are NOT allowed to obtain the exam in any manner, such as asking to see it from a student that did take the exam.  Also, if you miss an exam, you are NOT allowed to look at the exam solutions when they are made available online.  A missed exam must be made up at the Professor's earliest convenience.  Because it is a huge undertaking to plan, review, check or errors, and grade makeup exams, makeup exams are in general slighly more difficult than the original exam.</p>
		<p>Note: it is ok for anyone to look at old exams FROM ANOTHER SEMESTER.  But you are not allowed to look at any exam (or solutions) FROM THIS SEMESTER if you did not take that exam.</p>

		<h3>Project</h3>

		<p>You may (i.e., it is allowed) give help to and receive help from anyone about any computer, any operating system, and any programming language, and about error messages from any of these.</p>
		<p>Regarding the given project itself, you <b>may not</b> get help from anyone other than the instructor and the teaching assistants. You <b>may not</b> look at, or copy, code related to the project written by anyone other than your instructor or a teaching assistant, nor may you allow your code to be copied by anyone else, and you <b>may not</b> have copies of code written by other students in your possession. You must take care not to leave copies of your code in publicly accessible areas.</p>
		<p><b>WARNING:</b> A sophisticated program is used to compare the project code submitted by all students.  If your program is found to be strongly similar to another student's program, both students will be reported the Honor Council, along with all available evidence.</p>

		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>No exceptions are made for tutors.</p>
		<p>It is your obligation to make certain that you understand and abide by these rules. If you have any doubts, ask your instructor for clarification, not another student and not a teaching assistant.</p>
